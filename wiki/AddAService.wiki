#summary How add a service in GUtil!

Add a Google service in GUtil! is very easy.

A little How To for me :) :
  # Add the service in `./util/gutil_items.csv`
  # Run `gen.bat` or `gen.sh` in `./util/`
  # Add the name of the service in `./content/gutil.js` and `./content/options.js`
  # Run `build.bat` or `build.sh` in `./`

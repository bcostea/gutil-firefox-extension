gutil-firefox-extension
=======================

GUtil! is a Firefox extension designed to ease the access to all Google services.

I built GUtil back in 2006 as a pet project, learning XUL.

GUtil! is being discontinued. Please read http://www.gridpulse.com/2010/02/22/the-uncertain-future-of-gutil/

This extension started from the fact that I needed to access my Google services faster. It now contains almost all Google services plus most of the Labs projects.

GUtil! is available in English, French, Romanian and Russian. You can contribute to add your own language !
